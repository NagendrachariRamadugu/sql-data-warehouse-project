# Data Warehouse and Analytics Project ðŸš€

This project represents my hands-on journey in building a complete **data warehouse and analytics system** using SQL Server. It demonstrates how raw data can be transformed into structured, insightful models through well-designed ETL processes and multi-layer architecture. The project follows the Bronze, Silver, and Gold data flow â€” from ingestion to analysis â€” to ensure clarity, consistency, and business-ready insights.

I followed [**Baraaâ€™s 30 Hours SQL Full Course**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSKVgrwhzus&list=PPSV), which guided me through each stage of the process and helped me understand deeper concepts of data engineering and analytics. Through practical implementation, I learned how to design data pipelines, model relationships, and apply best practices for transforming data into meaningful insights.

Iâ€™m **Nagendra Chari**, a data enthusiast who enjoys turning raw information into knowledge that drives better decisions. This project reflects both my learning journey and my growing passion for data systems that bring structure and value to information. âœ¨
